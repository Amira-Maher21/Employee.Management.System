* [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server)
* [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) (optional for API testing)
* Visual Studio 2022 or VS Code

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/employee-management-system.git
cd employee-management-system
```

### 3. Update Connection String

In `appsettings.json`:

```json

## 🧪 Filtering, Sorting, and Logging Implementation

### 🔍 Filtering & Sorting

Filtering and sorting are implemented via LINQ in repository or service layers. You can easily pass query parameters such as:

```
GET /api/employees?name=Ali&sortBy=JoinDate&isDescending=true
```

This will:

* Filter employees by name `"Ali"`
* Sort by `JoinDate` in descending order.

> Advanced filtering logic can be moved to **Specification Pattern** if needed.

### 📝 Logging

Log history is recorded in the `LogHistories` table. For example:

* When an employee is added/updated/deleted
* Logs include timestamps, user info, and action type
* Logging is handled in `LogHistoryService` and triggered via `IMediator`

---

## 🧠 Assumptions Made

* Each employee **must** belong to one department.
* Department names are **unique**.
* The project is intended for **internal HR use**, so no public authentication is implemented (JWT support is pluggable).
* Database is initialized via EF Core migrations.
* Actions like "Add", "Update", "Delete" are assumed to be logged automatically through service methods.
